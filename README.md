This testbench verifies a D Flip-Flop (DFF) using a structured approach with generator, driver, monitor, scoreboard, and environment. Transactions are randomized and passed through mailboxes for verification. The scoreboard compares expected vs. actual outputs and reports results. Run the testbench with a simulator and analyze dump.vcd for waveform inspection. Modify gen.count or constraints in transaction for customization.
